# JsonQuoter
An Ada library to read a json-formated database of quotations.

This is similar to the Quoter repository, but that one was an executable
while this one is reworked as a library.

This used to rely on GNATColl.JSON
but now relies on [Jula](https://github.com/johnperry-math/jula),
which better addresses my needs.
